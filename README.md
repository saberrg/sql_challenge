# Module 9 SQL Challenge

In this assignment an Entity Relationship Design (ERD) was created to show the shared columns (a.k.a. the relationship) between the six tables (data modeling). After that the tables with their respective relationships was created (data engineering). Finally some analysis (through sql) was done with the data, for example listing all the employees.
